### I don't recommend using this if you're not me.

This is my personal arch install script. It automatically installs all of my preferred packages and dotfiles. It will also format a selected drive with an EFI, root, and swap partition. If you'd like to format your own drive, you should comment out the whole formatting and mounting section and do it manually.

Prior to running the script, install git and dialog with pacman.
